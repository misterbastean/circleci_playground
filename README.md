# Portfolio

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/misterbastean/circleci_playground.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/misterbastean/circleci_playground)

This is an old portfolio I created when I was getting started. I only keep the landing page updated, as it deploys to my personal website.

The one actually useful site in here is [MealApp](https://www.misterbastean.com/mealapp), which I use to keep track of recipes.
